# Pima Indians Diabetes Analysis

## Introduction

This project seeks to give a deeper understanding on whether a patient has diabetes or not and what factors may add to the likelihood of one being a diabetic.

## Significance
- Early detection of diabetes is crucial for effective management and prevention of complications.
- Machine learning models can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk, enabling timely interventions.
- This dataset has been used extensively, and therefore provides a good platform to test and compare different machine learning models.

### Dataset
The data contains measurements such as: 
* The Number of pregnancies
* Glucose concentration
* Blood pressure
* Skin thickness
* Insulin levels
* Body mass index (BMI)
* Diabetes pedigree function
* Age
* Outcome (diabetes diagnosis)

### Tools Used

- **Tools include: python, oandas for data processing, seaborn and matpotlib for visualization, numpy and jupyter notebook.


## Key Project Steps
### Data Preprocessing
* Handling missing values: Addressing incomplete data through imputation.
* Outlier detection and treatment: Identifying and managing extreme values that may distort model performance.
* Feature scaling and normalization: Standardizing the range of features to ensure consistent model input.
* Feature selection: Selecting the most relevant features to improve model accuracy and efficiency.
* Data splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

### Model Training
* Exploring various machine learning algorithms: Such as logistic regression,random forests, and K-Nearest Neighbor.
* Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model parameters to achieve the best possible performance.

### Model Evaluation
* Assessing model performance using metrics: Such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Generating confusion matrices and classification reports: To provide a detailed understanding of model predictions.

## Conclusion
- In essence, this project offers a valuable opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world healthcare problem, with the potential to contribute to improved diabetes diagnosis and management.
